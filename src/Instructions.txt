Instructions to run:

1. Please make sure you have installed TensorFlow, scikit-learn, opencv2 and matplot lib or library required to run the code. Don't import any new python libraries.

2. Put the train and val directories on the same level as your code.
   
3. After reviewing the code,
    Run the script test_cnn.py on the dataset.
    Result should be the resulting confusion matrix.
    Running time: 5-10 mins

4. Run the file train_cnn.py
    Result should be the resulting chart. 	
    Running time: 30-40 mins

5. Result should be a total of 15 images from passing the images of the 3 different fruit and veggies through different convolution layers and filters.
    Running time on AWS (with 4-8GPU, 16RAM) - 1 hour  

6. Run the train_nn.py
   Result should be performance chart.
